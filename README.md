# Natural Language Processing
repository for natural language processing projects and scripts

1. **NLP_guide1.ipynb**
  - Guide with basic commands for text preprocessing in NLP.
2. **NLP01_Spacy.ipynb**
  - Guided activity on natural language processing using the SpaCy library for the course Neural Processing of Natural Language in Portuguese I (University of SÃ£o Paulo).
3. **text-generation_hugginface.ipynb**
    - text generation with a model from Meta's LLaMA family, using quantization to optimize execution on GPUs with less VRAM.
4. **next**
  - description
5. **temperature_comparison.ipynb**
  - This project demonstrates the *impact of temperature* on text generation by large-scale language models (LLMs). We use the `Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct` model.
