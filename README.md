# Natural Language Processing
repository for natural language processing projects and scripts

1. ðŸ“„ **NLP_guide1.ipynb** [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/thiagotims/nlp/blob/main/NLP_guide1.ipynb)
  - Guide with basic commands for text preprocessing in NLP.
2. ðŸ“„ **NLP01_Spacy.ipynb** [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/thiagotims/nlp/blob/main/NLP01_Spacy.ipynb)
  - Guided activity on natural language processing using the SpaCy library for the course Neural Processing of Natural Language in Portuguese I (University of SÃ£o Paulo).
3. ðŸ“„ **text_generation_hugginface.ipynb** [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/thiagotims/nlp/blob/main/text_generation_hugginface.ipynb)
  - Text generation with a model from Meta's LLaMA family, using quantization to optimize execution on GPUs with less VRAM.
4. ðŸ“„ **text-generation_huggingface-gemma.ipynb** [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/thiagotims/nlp/blob/main/text-generation_huggingface_gemma.ipynb)
  - Text generation with a model from Google's Gemma family, built for instruction tasks and using quantization to optimize execution on GPUs with less VRAM.
5. ðŸ“„ **temperature_comparison.ipynb** [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/thiagotims/nlp/blob/main/temperature_comparison.ipynb)
  - This project demonstrates the *impact of temperature* on text generation by large-scale language models (LLMs). We use the `Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct` model.
6.  ðŸ“„ **text-generation_lcel+runnables.ipynb** [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/thiagotims/nlp/blob/main/text_generation_lcel%2Brunnables.ipynb)
  - This project implements a text generation pipeline using LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) and Runnables with Meta's Llama 2 model. Through this approach, it is possible to create structured prompts, optimize model execution, and add custom functions such as word count in the generated text.
7.  ðŸ“„ **text-generation_lcel+functions.ipynb** [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/thiagotims/nlp/blob/main/text_generation_lcel%2Bfunctions.ipynb)
- This project implements a text generation pipeline using LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) and Runnables with Meta's Llama 2 model. In addition to the structured prompt-based text generation functionality, this version includes additional custom functions using Runnables that process the model's output. In addition to the word count functionality, there is a text complexity calculation, measuring the average number of words per sentence.
