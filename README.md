# Natural Language Processing
repository for natural language processing projects and scripts

1. 📄 **NLP_guide1.ipynb** 
  - Guide with basic commands for text preprocessing in NLP.
2. 📄 **NLP01_Spacy.ipynb** [🔗](https://github.com/thiagotims/nlp/blob/main/NLP01_Spacy.ipynb)
  - Guided activity on natural language processing using the SpaCy library for the course Neural Processing of Natural Language in Portuguese I (University of São Paulo).
3. 📄 **text_generation_hugginface.ipynb**
  - Text generation with a model from Meta's LLaMA family, using quantization to optimize execution on GPUs with less VRAM.
4. 📄 **text-generation_huggingface-gemma.ipynb**
  - Text generation with a model from Google's Gemma family, built for instruction tasks and using quantization to optimize execution on GPUs with less VRAM.
5. 📄 **temperature_comparison.ipynb**
  - This project demonstrates the *impact of temperature* on text generation by large-scale language models (LLMs). We use the `Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct` model.
